# Time Series Classification with LSTNet

This project is focused on time series classification using a modified LSTNet model. It aims to help users train and evaluate time series classification models for various applications.

## Overview

Time series classification is a common task in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and industrial processes. This project provides a modified LSTNet model for time series classification. It includes:

- `LSTNet_TSC.py`: The main Python script for training and evaluating the time series classification model.
- `LSTNet.py`: The LSTNet model implementation.
- `Optim.py`: The optimization module for handling various optimization methods.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x)
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Other necessary dependencies (as mentioned in `LSTNet_TSC.py`)

## File Descriptions

- `LSTNet_TSC.py`: The main script for training and evaluating the time series classification model.
- `LSTNet.py`: The implementation of the LSTNet model.
- `Optim.py`: The module for handling optimization methods.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing and batching.
